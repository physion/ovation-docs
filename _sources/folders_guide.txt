Files and Folders
*****************

Ovation makes it easy to upload files to Project *Folders* in the Ovation cloud. Ovation keeps local copies of uploaded files so you continue to use the same apps to work with your files, just like they were stored on your computer's hard drive. But in Ovation, your folders become even more powerful. Ovation automatically synchronizes Project files & folders with your collaborators. You can add annotations to Folders including Keyword Tags, Notes, and Properties. And you can add :ref:`Analysis Records <doc-analysis-records-guide>` to folders that link results in that folder to input files in any Project, Folder, or Experiment in your Ovation database.


Adding Files & Folders
======================

To upload new files, drag-and-drop the file(s)/folder(s) onto the appropriate drop zone in the Ovation desktop. You can drag-and-drop individual file(s) or entire folder trees. Ovation will create nested Folders for any folders you upload.

To a Project
------------

To add new file(s) or folder(s) to a Project, drag-and-drop the file(s) and/or folder(s) from the Finder (OS X) or Windows Explorer (Windows) onto the "Drop files to upload" zone in the Project info window.

Moving Files & Folders
======================

You can drag-and-drop files or folders within the Projects Navigator to move them to another folder. You can also copy files or folders to another folder using your computer's copy-gesture during drag (the ``Alt`` key on Windows or ``Option`` key on OS X).

File Revisions
==============

Ovation tracks each version of stored files. Ovation does not automatically upload a new version of a file if you modify it locally, but you can choose to upload a new version any time. If you modify a file and want to upload the new version, select "Save Version" from the file's context menu.
