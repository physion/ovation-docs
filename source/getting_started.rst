Once you've :ref:`installed <doc-installation>` Ovation, you're ready to start organizing your data. Ovation organizes data using entities ("nouns") that are familiar to scientists: Projects, Experiments, Protocols, Measurements, etc. Each instance of these (and other) entities stored in the are called "objects".

.. sidebar:: Object identity

    Every object in the Ovation database has a unique identityâ€”a globally unique identifier such as `C3617DF6-3296-434E-890D-4AA730A80431`.

This tutorial will demonstrate adding numeric, image and tabular `Measurements` to a new `Project`.


Authentication
==============

Before you can add data to your Ovation database, you must login using your email address and `ovation.io`_ password.

.. note:: If you're forgotten your `ovation.io`_ password, you can `reset <https://ovation.io/users/password/new>`_ it.
