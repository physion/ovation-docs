.. Now that you have created a Project with associated Experiments, Measurements and Sources, you can create a Team to start collaborating on the Project.   A Team within Ovation not only enables you to share data, analyses, notes and more with colleagues and peers, it gives you a platform for exchanging ideas and building on hypotheses with collaborators.  You can share multiple Projects with a Team and invited Team Members can add Projects of their own to a Team.  So, let’s get collaborating!
..
.. To create a team, visit `ovation.io <http://ovation.io>`_ and login to your Ovation account.
..
.. You will be taken to your Ovation dashboard where you can view all of your current teams.

..
..
.. .. tip:: You can optionally add a custom user license to any Team.  Each Team Member will need to accept the terms  of that license prior to joining the Team.
..
.. Next, invite Team Members by adding the email address associated with their Ovation account.  If your collaborator does not have an Ovation account, just enter their email address and they will receive a prompt to sign up.

..
..
.. Finally, add a Project by typing the Project Name in the box to the right.  A list of your Projects in Ovation will auto-populate as you begin to type.

..
..
.. That’s it!  Your invited Team Members will now receive an email with instructions on how to join the Team.

.. note:: Your Team Members may need to sync their desktop Ovation with their Ovation.io account before they can see the Project.  This is done by selecting "Sync" from the "Tools" menu in Ovation.
