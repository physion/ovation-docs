Files and Folders
*****************

Ovation makes it easy to upload folders and files to the Ovation cloud. You can store Folders under any Ovation Project. Once uploaded, you can use the files and folders just as you would folders on your computer's hard drive but in Ovation, your Folders become even more powerful. Ovation automatically synchronizes Project files & folders with your collaborators. You can add annotations including Keyword Tags, Notes, and Properties, to folders. And you can add Analysis Records to folders that tie results in that folder to input files in any Project, Folder, or Experiment in your Ovation database.


Adding Files & Folders
======================

To add new files, or a folder tree containing files and/or nested folders, drag-and-drop the file(s)/folder(s) onto the appropriate drop zone in the Ovation desktop.

To a Project
------------

To add new file(s) or folder(s) to a Project, drag-and-drop the file(s) and/or folder(s) from the Finder (OS X) or Windows Explorer (Windows) onto the "Drop files to upload" zone in the Project info window.

Moving Files & Folders

File Revisions
==============

Ovation tracks each version of stored files. Ovation does not automatically upload a new version of a file if you modify it locally, but you can choose to upload a new version any time. If you modify a file and want to upload the new version, select "Save Version" from the file's context menu.
