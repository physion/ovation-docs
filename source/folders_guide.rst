Files and Folders
*****************

Ovation makes it easy to upload folders and files to the Ovation cloud. You can store Folders under any Ovation ``Project``. Once uploaded, you can use the files and folders just as you would folders on your computer's hard drive but in Ovation, your Folders become even more powerful. Ovation automatically synchronizes Project files & folders with your collaborators. You can add annotations including Keyword Tags, Notes, and Properties, to folders. And you can add Analysis Records to folders that tie results in that folder to input files in any Project, Folder, or Experiment in your Ovation database.
