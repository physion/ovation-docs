Protocols and Procedures
************************

``Protocols`` describe a ``Procedure`` for making a *Measurement*, creating a new *Source* or performing an *Analysis*. Ovation ``Protocol`` objects may contain written textual description. They may also contain a reference to computer code describing the process. Each ``Protocol`` should be represented only once in the Ovation database, even if the Procedure it describes is performed many times.

A ``Procedure`` references the ``Protocol`` object and stores *protocol parameter* values, the values of any *variables* in the Procedure description such as reagent concentration, lot number, time intervals, etc.
